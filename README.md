Hangman Origin

"The origins of Hangman are obscure meaning not discovered, but it seems to have arisen in Victorian times,"
 says Tony Augarde, author of The Oxford Guide to Word Games. The game is mentioned in Alice Bertha Gomme's "Traditional Games" 
in 1894 under the name "Birds, Beasts and Fishes."
